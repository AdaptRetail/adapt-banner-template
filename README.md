<a name="whats-included"></a>
## Whats included

This template is using multiple best practices principles for Adapt Retail banners.
You do not have to follow them, so change whatever you want.

Anyways,
we are including ability to **swipe between product swiper** on touch devices and desktops,
and we **stop the carousel on user interaction**.
The banner is **lazy loading product images** when the product shows. 
We have included examples of how to **handle product bombs**,
example of how to handle a **splitted price tag**,
and thanks to [Laravel mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/mix), **we automaticly adds legacy support**.

<a name="install"></a>
## Install

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/AdaptRetail/banner-template

# Go to directory
cd banner-template

# Install dependencies
npm install 
```

<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage

> All dependencies must be [installed](#install) before you can start using the template.

This template is using `npm`, `Sass` and `Webpack` to build your files and containing [some extra helpers](#dependencies) to make things easier for you.

<a name="npm-run-watch"></a>
### Local development

```bash
# Open file in default browser (browser-sync) and
# auto refresh browser on file save
npm run watch
```
> You can also display your production on other devices on your local network.
> Check your terminal for information after running `npm run watch`.

<a name="npm-run-prod"></a>
### Prepare files for production

```bash
# Compile files to dist/ folder
npm run prod
```

The `npm run prod` command is compiling and minifying the css and javascript.
All your files will be compiled to the `dist/` folder.

<a name="files"></a>
### Files

All your production files will be found in the `src/` folder.

We have provided the files with some content, but
this is your files and we don't tell you what you do. 
This is our approach when we are creating production, 
and you may add, move and remove files however you want.

> All files are thoroughly commented, so if you're in doubt, just read the source. 

<a name="script"></a>
#### [`src/Script/main.js`](https://github.com/AdaptRetail/banner-template/blob/master/src/Script/main.js)

This is the main file for your JavaScript.
What to do from this point is totally up to you.

This file will be compiled down with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) using [laravel-mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix).
This gives you some cool opertunities like.

- [Up to ECMAScript 6 (ES6) JavaScript syntax](http://es6-features.org/)
- [Import packages through NPM modules](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- And more

<a name="style"></a>
#### [`src/Style/main.scss`](https://github.com/AdaptRetail/banner-template/blob/master/src/Style/main.scss)

This is the main Sass file.
This file is including all the other sass files.
Do whatever you want from here.

We have set up some logic to get you started. Browse through the files and see what each file does.
If you want to overwrite some variables you can do it in [`src/Style/Utilities/Variables.scss`](https://github.com/AdaptRetail/banner-template/blob/master/src/Style/Utilities/Variables.scss).

> Most of the files are containing variables you can over write in this file.
> Just add the variable here, and it will be overwritten.
> Try `$google-font-name: "Lobster";`

<a name="views"></a>
#### `src/views/`

This folder is optional and is only there for our workflow in the [src/Scripts/main.js](#script); where we are including `.html` files instead of using strings.

<a name="dependencies"></a>
## Dependencies

This project is using different dependencies to make it easier to make display banners.

<a name="banner-style"></a>
### [Banner style](https://github.com/AdaptRetail/banner-style)

Micro frontend framework containing helpers like `grid` system using flex.

<a name="sass-asset-inline"></a>
### [sass-asset-inline](https://github.com/LasseHaslev/sass-asset-inliner)

Inline assets like `image` and `fonts` in your sass files with simple syntax.

```scss
@font-face {
    src: inline-font( 'path/to/your/font.ttf' ); // Include full font

    // Subset font by adding regex as second parameter
    // of each character you want to include
    src: inline-font( 'path/to/your/font.ttf', '[0-9]' );
}

body {
    // Inline image
    background-image: inline-image( 'path/to/your/image.png' );

    // Inline and resize image to width (Kepp aspect ratio)
    background-image: inline-image( 'path/to/your/image.png', "200" );

    // Resize image and ignoring aspect ratio
    background-image: inline-image( 'path/to/your/image.png', "200x400" );

    // Resize image to height and keep aspect ratio
    background-image: inline-image( 'path/to/your/image.png', "_x400" );

    // Underscore works also for height.
    // ("200x_" equals "200" as shown above)
}
```

> All files are included from your root folder.

### [Adapt Data](https://github.com/AdaptRetail/banner-data)

Communicate with Adapt Retail productions through our API.

### [laravel-mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix)

We are extending [laravel-mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix) with [Laravel mix extender](https://github.com/AdaptRetail/adapt-mix-extender) to include helpers like the [sass-asset-inline](#sass-asset-inline)

<a name="extracted-style"></a>
## Extracted style

Some of the style of this template has been extracted [to another git repository](https://github.com/AdaptRetail/priceco-style).
This is to reuse the elements and components in other productions.

This is a recommendation if you are creating multiple templates for [Adapt Retail](https://adaptretail.com).

> Remove the priceco style from the project by removing `@import "../../node_modules/@priceco/style/src/main.scss";` line in `src/Style/main.scss`.

<a name="publish"></a>
